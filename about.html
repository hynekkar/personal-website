## About

  As a senior researcher at CESNET and an assistant professor at the Czech Technical University, I specialize in leveraging artificial intelligence to address complex challenges in cybersecurity. Over the years, I’ve contributed to numerous national and international security projects, delivering innovative solutions that help protect critical infrastructures and digital environments.

  Passionate about mentoring and knowledge-sharing, I thrive in both academic and applied research settings, building bridges between theoretical insights and real-world applications. If you’re interested in AI, security, or collaborative research, I’d love to connect and discuss potential opportunities!

  I am privileged to lead a team of talented researchers, pushing the boundaries of knowledge and driving impactful research that combines AI, machine learning, and network security. Together, we explore cutting-edge technologies to make digital spaces safer and more resilient.
